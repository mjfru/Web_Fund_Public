    <h1>Why Indentation?</h1>
    <p>This page will cover two important concepts, proper indentation and parent-child-sibling relationship.</p>
    <p>We, developers, don't indent our code to reflect the content. We indent to via the HTML tag's
        relationship to other tags. To center a paragraph title and indent at the start, we'll use CSS to do that.</p>
    <p>On this page in particular, the h1 tag 'Why Indentation?' is a child of the body tag. It's on the same line of 
        indentation, making it a sibling of the < p > tag.</p>
    <h2>So, is it really required to indent HTML?</h2>
    <p>It is, in fact, not required but highly, highly recommended.</p>
    <p>Some of those reasons include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beautiful code can make you happy!</li>
            <li>Less time to troubleshoot! Easier to spot missing closing tags because of indentation.</li>
            <li>Much easier to browse through your own code, you'll know exactly where everything is and where it should belong.</li>
            <li>Creates good coding habits that are transferable to other languages.</li>
        </ul>
